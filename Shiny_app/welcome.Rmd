## Welcome to Project COMPLAPSE

This R Shiny application was built to allow readers to explore the formal, dynamical systems model developed as part of Project COMPLAPSE.

This R Shiny application includes the following tabs:

- Simulation Scenarios (contains a few pre-specified simulation scenarios)
- Simulation Environment (environment in which all model parameters can be tuned via sliders)
